# What does `create-react-app` do?
It is a command line tool that helps create a boilerplate react project with the pre-configured development environment. 

This includes the build setup using module bundlers like Webpack and a development server for testing the application locally. 

It also sets up a testing environment using Jest and provides the necessary configurations for writing and executing tests for your React components.

This helps developers to get started quickly in building their applications instead of spending time on configuring setups for the build.
